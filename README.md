# Pointed

This is an (almost) direct translation of Emily Pillmore's excellent
[smash](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/smash) Haskell library.

## TODO for first release

- [ ] Cut a release (tag)
- [ ] Add to package-sets
- [ ] Publish docs on pursuit (?)

## Ideas for the future

Can we make a _pointed_ generic type? That is, a `Pointed xs`, which has all
types in `xs` as `Maybe`s, with an extra maybe on the top. Might be worth
investigating.

Add tests!
